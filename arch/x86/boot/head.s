 * not got it, why should you :-) The source is here. Chnage
 * it. (Seriously - it shouldn't be too difficult. Mostly
 * change some constants etc. I left it at 16Mb, as my machine
 * even cannot be extended past that (OK, but it was cheap :-)
 * I've tried to show which constants to change by having
 * some kind of marker at them (search for "16Mb"), but I
