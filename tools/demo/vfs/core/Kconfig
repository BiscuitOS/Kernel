          A virtual file system (VFS) or virtual filesystem switch is 
          an abstraction layer on top of a more concrete file system. 
          The purpose of a VFS is to allow client applications to access
          different types of concrete file systems in a uniform way. 
          A VFS can, for example, be used to access local and network
          storage devices transparently without the client application
          noticing the difference.
