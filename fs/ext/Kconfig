	  The extended file system, or ext, was implemented in April 
	  1992 as the first file system created specifically for the 
	  Linux kernel. It has metadata structure inspired by the 
	  traditional Unix File System (UFS) and was designed by RÃ©my 
	  Card to overcome certain limitations of the MINIX file system.
	  It was the first implementation that used the virtual file 
	  system (VFS), for which support was added in the Linux 
	  kernel in version 0.96c, and it could handle file systems 
	  up to 2 gigabytes (GB) in size.
