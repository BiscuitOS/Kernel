### Usage

  This OS running on X86 machine, if you don't have X86 machine, you 
  can use X86 emulator to run OS. This OS have ran on `qemu`, `qemu` is 
  an useful X86 emulator to emulate environment of X86. Please follow 
  specific steps to make it work.

  1. Install essential tools

	  ```
	  sudo apt-get install qemu
	  sudo apt-get install figlet gcc make gdb git
	  sudo apt-get install cflow graphviz gawk indent
	  ```

	 If you use 64 bit system, please install 32 bit library.
	
	  ```
	  sudo apt-get install lib32z1 lib32z1-dev
	  ```

  2. Download source code

     Download souce code from github, please connect network first.
	
	  ```
	  git clone https://github.com/BuddyZhang1/BiscuitOS.git
	  ```

  3. Compile BiscuitOS
  
	  ```
      make clean  
      make 
      make start
      ```

  4. Debug BiscuitOS

     If you want to debug BiscuitOS, please open debug macro on top Makefile.
	
	  ```
	  vi */BiscuitOS/Makefile
	  --- DEBUG := 
	  +++ DEBUG := 1
	  ```
	
	 Then, recompile source code.
	
	  ```
	  make clean
	  make
	  ```
	
	 Now, we can start to debug OS.
	 On Host:
      
	  ```
      make debug
      ```
     On Target:

	    You can utilize `gdb` to single debug and so on. follow these steps:
	    
		```
	    gdb tools/build/system
	    (gdb)target remote :1234
	    (gdb)b main
	    (gdb)c
	    (gdb)n
	    or 
	    (gdb)s
	    ```
	  
	  You can also utilize `objdump` to get more useful information, such as:
	    
		```
	    objdump -x -s -S -dh tools/build/system
	    ```

	  If you want to debug `bootsect.s` and `setup.s`, you should follow
	  these steps:
        
		```
        gdb tools/build/.debug_bootsect
	    or 
        gdb tools/build/.debug_setup
        (gdb)target remote :1234
        (gdb)b *0x7C00
        (gdb)c
        (gdb)d
	    (gdb)(delete break?)y
	    (gdb)ni
	    or 
	    (gdb)si
        ```
	  
	  You can also uitlize `objdump` to get more useful information,like:
	    
		```
	    objdump -x -s -S -dh tools/build/.debug_bootsect
	    ```

  5. Draw calling graph

     BiscuitOS supports automatic draw calling graph of function. If you want
	 to utilize this tools, you should follow these steps:
	 ```
       cd */BiscuitOS/
	   make draw FUN=xxx
	 ```
	 Basic command `make draw` that draws a new calling graph, you should
	 input function name (like `make draw FUN=printk`).

	 And, The `firefox` browser will display the calling graph. 

	 Note! This tools base on `firefox` browser, so you should install 
	 `firefox` on your PC.
